# Android host sample

[简体中文](README.md) · **English**


The sample `MainActivity` owns one JNI handle and sends complete JSON batches
to the Rust `container-host-android` cdylib. It also owns a `SurfaceView` with
an EGL/GLES window surface. When the current EGL context is available, the
surface attaches it to Skia Ganesh and asks the runtime to draw the committed
manifest frame directly into the window framebuffer. `WEAPP_CONTAINER_SURFACE_PROBE` reports
`containerSurfaceAttached=true`, `gpuSurface=true` and
`rendererBackend=skia-gpu-gles` only after that direct draw succeeds and the
same session's runtime capabilities acknowledge a GPU surface. If Skia
cannot attach, the sample keeps the previous one-shot RGBA texture upload and
reports `software-fallback` with an explicit evidence boundary.

The Activity loads `app/src/main/assets/portable-pack`, a checked-in portable
pack generated from `artifacts/reference`. It verifies the manifest integrity
root using unsigned UTF-8 key ordering and every original/executable
module/template/style/asset blob SHA-256 before changing the runtime.
`PortablePack.start` sends `app.init → app.lifecycle(launch) → page.push →
render.commit` to one native handle. `app.init` invokes `App.onLaunch`, and
the launch transition invokes the initial `App.onShow` before page hooks.
Rendering uses the route's manifest
template and live AppService data, including `onLoad/setData`; it does not
substitute a test rectangle. Refresh the checked-in fixture with:

```sh
node scripts/sync-android-portable-pack.mjs --source artifacts/reference
```

The pack is an input fixture for the host smoke. It does not turn an Android
software or EGL probe into GPU/device parity evidence.

The configured loader requires the requested native engine provider. A build
without that provider returns `ERR_ENGINE` before startup and never falls
back to another engine or an empty app. The older default-load C ABI remains
available to existing callers. `MainActivity` accepts intent string extras
`weappContainerEngine=quickjs|v8`, `weappContainerSessionId`, and
`weappContainerFixtureId`; omitted fixture ID is `portable-pack-reference-v1`
(the same fixture identity as iOS). Omitted engine
selects QuickJS, and omitted session ID creates a fresh UUID for the Activity.

After acknowledged startup, the sample atomically writes
`files/portable-pack-execution.json` in its own app data directory. It retains
the full correlated startup requests/responses, verified snapshot metadata,
manifest, engine, session and frame IDs. The first successfully swapped startup
frame freezes this file with its surface receipt; later interactive frames
never overwrite the startup identity. A new Activity clears the previous file first. This
avoids relying on truncated Logcat records. Binary build identity remains
`unknown` until an external build/installation harness proves it; the app
does not infer provenance from a source checkout.

Startup waits for the actual `SurfaceView` extent and root `WindowInsets`.
`Display.getRealSize` supplies a separate current-orientation screen extent;
`resources.displayMetrics.density` supplies the observed pixel ratio. Extents
are divided by that density and rounded to the nearest logical pixel, with
positive half ties upward; invalid/zero observations fail instead of using
a default ratio or clamping a logical extent. These values reach host
providers before any app modules run. Configuration supplies orientation;
it is not inferred from the viewport aspect ratio. `screenTop` uses the
decor window's observed upper edge, separately from the Surface input origin.
Status-bar insets use `getInsetsIgnoringVisibility` on API 30+, excluding IME;
API 26–29 use stable top with an explicit diagnostic limitation. These are
host mapping contracts, not established fixed-DevTools equivalence. Raw
insets remain diagnostic: the portrait-coordinate origin for public
`safeArea` is unproven, so this field is omitted rather than synthesized.
`PortablePackSession` then owns native input, lifecycle, timers and rerenders
on the Activity main thread. Each Android input batch crosses JNI once;
Rust performs hit testing, capture/target/bubble, datasets and component
handler dispatch against its committed frame. Surface-local touch coordinates
are scaled to that logical viewport. Single-pointer start/move/end/cancel and
tap are implemented; multi-touch cancels the active gesture. Longpress,
scroll recognition and native pointer target capture remain partial.

Surface resize updates the same Rust session's `HostMetadata`, synchronous
`wx.getWindowInfo`/system-info providers, `Page.onResize` and live component
`pageLifetimes.resize`, then rebuilds the manifest frame without loading a new
isolate. Activity configuration changes retain that owner.
One complete JSON observation crosses JNI atomically, including when only
density, screen size or insets changed. Display-only updates refresh provider
values without replaying `onResize`; duplicate observations do nothing. The
older size-only C ABI remains available and preserves existing display data.
Resume/pause send deduplicated show/hide transitions through App, the current Page and its live
components. Insets are captured from incoming Decor dispatch before the default Decor policy;
the listener calls that policy and returns its result unchanged. A consuming
content parent cannot block this window-level observation. Surface geometry is
joined only at preDraw after layout, with actual holder frame, Surface callback
extents and View layout agreeing. Decor reattachment requires a new Insets
epoch; a Surface-only recreation can retain the current Window epoch.
`WEAPP_CONTAINER_WINDOW_OBSERVATION` logs versioned pending/ready diagnostics
and dispatch/layout provenance without treating cached Insets as fresh.
Resume first forces one complete valid window observation, even
when unchanged, and refreshes native provider values before dispatching show;
an invalid observation never resumes user hooks. This order is an implementation regression contract; joint
App/Page background callback ordering has not been established by the fixed
DevTools oracle. Choreographer polls timers only while
foreground. Its uptime timestamp schedules callbacks only: every actual poll
samples `System.currentTimeMillis()` and converts Unix epoch milliseconds to
nanoseconds, matching Rust `SystemTime` and AppService `Date.now()` deadlines.
Surface submission or presentation-ACK failure sets `presentationSuspended`:
input and automatic redraw stop while business timers and foreground lifecycle
continue. The embedding owner may call `MainActivity.retryPresentation()` to
restore its EGL context and explicitly submit current state; input resumes only
after a matching successful presentation ACK. Fatal runtime/protocol errors
remain separate and stop the timer pump.
The conversion rejects negative or signed-JNI overflow values before native
dispatch, rather than clamping or wrapping into a different date. Destruction
unloads once before releasing EGL and the JNI
handle. Continuous media-query observer notifications remain partial.

Debuggable APKs additionally publish `files/portable-pack-interaction.json`:
the session/integrity, logical viewport, actual host dimensions, page data,
full committed `RenderFrame` (`frame_id`), bounded operation/lifecycle/error
history and a pixel-free snapshot digest. Surface geometry records physical
extent, density and screen origin. Top-level `windowObservation` records raw Display/Surface extents, density,
rotation/configuration, distinct window/surface origins and stable insets,
with the Android API sources named. Top-level `displayMetrics` comes from
the Rust inspection, separately from those raw observations. Both the frozen
startup receipt and dynamic interaction receipt include this distinction.
`surface.presentedFrameId` advances only
after `eglSwapBuffers` succeeds and stays distinct from the committed frame;
surface loss clears that identity and backend until a new successful swap.
A same-size replacement Surface re-presents the last committed frame after a
valid join and successful native synchronization, without reloading the session
or manufacturing a new frame.
Before drawing, the presenter queries the current EGL drawable allocation.
SurfaceView geometry alone does not establish its backing size: the tested
emulator can keep the previous allocation until a swap. A mismatch retires and
recreates only the EGLSurface, preserves the context and live JS session, and
rechecks the acquired size before calling the renderer. Persistent mismatch
reports `ERR_RENDER`; it cannot receive a successful presentation receipt.
`surface.drawableObservation` v2 retains target epoch, allocation and GL state
before the transition, before/after drawing and after swap. The credited frame
must retain the accepted physical extent and current EGL target throughout.
EGL handle identities use unsigned hexadecimal strings so JSON consumers
retain every pointer bit. They identify only this live process, not a portable
resource or a stable identity across launches.
Zero means no frame is currently presented. Background and failed sessions report
`suspended` with separate `foreground`, `runtimeFailed`, `presentationSuspended`
and diagnostics fields. Empty timer
polls do not write receipts. Page/layout inspection is development-only and
is not persisted by release builds. GPU rerenders pass committed frame metadata
without RGBA readback; the startup screenshot remains an explicit diagnostic.
Input/frame latency has not passed a performance gate.

Build the native artifact first:

```sh
pnpm native:build -- --platform android
```

The native builder selects `quickjs-native-android` by default. This feature
uses NDK/bindgen bindings for the actual Android ABI; plain desktop QuickJS
bindings are not reused. An explicit `--engine v8` requests V8 and must fail
when that target's native provider cannot build; it never substitutes QuickJS.

With Android Gradle Plugin, the NDK and an installed Gradle wrapper available,
assemble the arm64 APK by passing the artifact explicitly:

```sh
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug \
  -PweappContainerAndroidRustLib="$PWD/../../../target/aarch64-linux-android/debug/libcontainer_host_android.so"
```

The Gradle/CMake project is an integration skeleton. APK signing, installation
and emulator/device validation remain separate gates.

Run an APK on an explicitly selected target from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm host:android:app:smoke -- \
  --serial emulator-5572 --expected-avd YourTaskAvd \
  --apk /absolute/path/to/app-debug.apk \
  --engine quickjs --out-dir artifacts/android-app-run
```

The output directory must be empty and the package must be absent on that
target. The runner uses a plain install, a unique session, and polls the app's
atomic receipt for the matching engine, fixture and attached Skia GLES frame.
It captures an OS screenshot between checks of the same PID/start time and
foreground package. Command bytes, diagnostics and screenshots are retained;
the runner removes only its installed app and leaves the target running.
It never selects the first device, replaces an existing app or clears Logcat.

For the bundled reference fixture, add the explicit interaction plan on a
selected official emulator and a debuggable APK:

```sh
pnpm host:android:app:smoke -- \
  --serial emulator-5572 --expected-avd YourTaskAvd \
  --apk /absolute/path/to/app-debug.apk \
  --engine quickjs --out-dir artifacts/android-reference-interaction \
  --interaction-plan reference
```

The plan reads committed bounds and the actual surface's screen origin before
issuing real adb page/component taps, checks page/component/slot updates,
resizes with `wm size`, verifies viewport/provider agreement in the same
session, then sends HOME and resumes that App. It restores the original
display size/density overrides and saves independent interaction receipts and
OS screenshots. Initial, resized, restored, density and resumed frames all
receive screenshot checks; a further OS tap after resize verifies the new hit
coordinates. Captures require the same frame, presentation sequence and EGL
target before/after capture. Up to five seconds of retries permit transient
compositor animations; every candidate PNG, correlated receipts and failure is
retained. The local geometry check compares opaque reference page/card/component
backgrounds with committed bounds and colors. It excludes text and is not an
official screenshot baseline; `visualStatus` stays `unknown`.
Each screenshot also names its exact `*-screen.json` accepted receipt. The
earlier polled receipt remains separate; subsequent input uses the accepted
capture's frame when it advances during compositor stabilization.
Startup evidence remains the frozen first-frame receipt. This validates only
the exercised emulator interactions; it is not DevTools parity, physical
device/hardware evidence or a performance result.

Without `--build-receipt`, source provenance remains `unknown` and the report
cannot pass the source gate. A saved `apk-validation.json` may be supplied with
`--build-receipt`; its native-input and isolated Gradle receipt hash chain must
match the exact APK. `--expected-source-commit` selects an explicit immutable
baseline when testing an older artifact; the harness commit and binary source
commit remain separate. The default baseline is the current HEAD.

Screenshot capture requires separate visual review. An attached Skia surface
does not establish hardware acceleration, touch, resize, app lifecycle, real
device or near-parity conformance. Run the runner's lifecycle/ownership tests
with `pnpm host:android:app:test`.

For the loader/protocol regression, run from the repository root:

```sh
node scripts/android-pack-contract-test.mjs
```

This uses pinned Kotlin 2.0.21/JVM dependencies from a read-only Gradle cache,
SDK 36, and NDK 27.1.12297006. Override their paths with `--gradle-cache`,
`--android-jar` and `--ndk`. It runs the production loader against a recording
runtime, compiles all production Kotlin with the Android SDK, and type-checks
the JNI adapter with the NDK. Clock tests cover epoch preservation, exact
millisecond conversion, invalid inputs and a recording-runtime callback at
its epoch deadline; they do not establish native timer execution. Its report explicitly excludes native JS,
Android process, EGL, GPU and device execution.
