# API Source Approval

[简体中文](source-review.md) · **English**


The source identity of the API manifest is saved in [Inspector](../../scripts/core-api-inventory.mjs). The complete file summary is uniformly saved by `reviewedSourceSha256`, and each capability check selects its own fixed source set; the control flow identity of JavaScript uses the canonical AST summary calculated by the fixed Acorn version. Source code changes must be reviewed, and the current summary cannot be automatically accepted when generating the matrix.

These identities only indicate that the specified source code has been reviewed. They do not prove full compiled behavior, full compatibility with official APIs, real-device execution, merchant transactions, or actual acceptance of each SDK. The status of the platform is still determined by the independent [Acceptance Ledger](./acceptance-ledger.json) and [Acceptance Contract](./acceptance-contracts.json).

## 2026-11-12 Review Scope

This time, we aim to compare the previously reviewed original content with the current content on a file-by-file basis based on the implementation in the open source code snapshot. Updated 20 full file identities, as well as AST identities that notify hub, installer, lifecycle, host bridge, and Promise rejection handling. No changes were made to the capability rating, acceptance deed, or acceptance ledger.

| Source | The Boundary of Change and Retention |
| --- | --- |
| `container-engine-quickjs/src/lib.rs`, `container-engine-v8/src/lib.rs` | Component data submission receipt and test-specific observation receiver; use private transmission and existing execution budget, do not obtain permissions from the application writable global, and do not drain additional tasks. |
| `container-runtime/src/lib.rs` | The development package is loaded in the isolation candidate and submitted atomically after acceptance; module registration and successful execution are recorded separately, and failed entries need to be explicitly retried. Host geometry changes revoke old input permissions. Restricted demo releases continue to deny debugging and module calls. |
| `container-runtime/src/route_transaction.rs` | Check whether the Page definition of the real page module is ready before navigation; unloaded routes cannot be executed by using the definitions of other pages. |
| `container-runtime/src/host_services.rs` | Host layout notifications join the runtime-owned API collection; platform providers cannot override this ownership. |
| `container-core/src/lib.rs`, `container-core/Cargo.toml` | Observation modules and exits are controlled by explicit test features and are turned off by default. |
| `container-core/src/finite-notifications.js`, `container-core/src/host-bridge.js` | Object image updates must occur after subscription, sequence, and owner admission; image updates do not become notification authorization sources. |
| `container-core/src/host-environment-install.js`, `container-core/src/lifecycle-notifications.js` | Owner of trusted installation, distribution, and exit phase management host layout notifications. |
| `container-core/src/host_environment.rs` | Installation layout and component receipts, test-specific logs remain private; failure to capture receipts cannot disrupt normal application writing. Full bootstrap byte identity continues to be hard-gated. |
| `container-sdk/src/lib.rs` | The immutable frame snapshot binds the actual accepted physical target and input life cycle, and the development overload uses atomic replacement; the restricted demo continues to prohibit the development load entry. |
| `container-host-web/src/lib.rs` | Bounded binary frames use the existing renderer/frame license; the sandbox must explicitly select development, which is denied for restricted releases. |
| `examples/hosts/web-wasm/worker-runtime.mjs` | Bounded concurrent packet fetching, item-by-item hashing and group cancellation; the hash is still verified after the font cache is read. Frame transfer and scheduling reserve budgets, exclusive tokens, and failure cleanup. |
| `container-host-common/src/lib.rs`, `container-runtime/src/browser_view.rs`, `container-runtime/src/render_backend.rs` | Metadata will be released after the development candidate is accepted; failure can only restore old frames that still have corresponding pages, surfaces, and life cycles. Canceling the operation does not restore the old coordinate input permission. |
| `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` | Workspace source code license and development and debugging information configuration; Harmony host adds existing SHA-256 dependencies. Licenses and snippets for older released assets remain unchanged. |
| `container-core/src/unhandled-rejections.js` | The test observation interval lasts until the final checkpoint after exit; the public listening distribution is retired immediately upon exit, and the handle cancellation is still valid. By default, notifications after exit are not retained when observation is turned off. |
| `container-core/src/error-notifications.js` | Recursive reporting first disables logs and exception observations, and then stops nested reporting. The checker verifies reachable direct recursion protection to avoid logging missing nested reports as complete evidence. |

The crate paths in the table are all located at `crates/`. The corresponding source, caller, configuration and failure path should be reviewed together, not just whether the method body or keywords exist.

Limited explicit use of non-performance test fixtures for browser owners, browser rendering protocols, and native selectors
2 s View Batch Budget. These use cases hit the 50 ms initialization deadline before entering ownership assertion;
The fixture separates protocol semantic verification from this performance threshold and does not use it to determine the specific cause of the timeout.
The production default value is still 50 ms, and the default loading path of the SDK still uses this value; configure the default value, outer deadline,
Cancellation, interruption and post-failure privilege revocation continue to be verified by dedicated testing. The fixture results do not demonstrate passing the 50 ms performance threshold.

Simulator configuration now forwards the runtime's existing finite `ViewExecutionPolicy`, replacing a unit-test-only configuration field so integration tests can explicitly choose a semantic-test budget. The default remains 50 ms. Initial load, development reload, and `default_session_config` share the same policy; the runtime still validates it and tightens the outer deadline.

## 2026-11-12 desktop GL host review

The following changes were reviewed file by file against this PR's baseline, updating the complete `runtime`, `commonHost`, and `workspaceLock` source identities. Capability ratings, acceptance contracts, and the acceptance ledger are unchanged.

| Source | Changes and preserved boundaries |
| --- | --- |
| `container-runtime/src/lib.rs` | Adds a passive GL attachment query that only reads the existing renderer; no GPU state creation or changes to the scheduler, budget, or presentation permissions. |
| `container-host-common/src/lib.rs` | Forwards passive queries and an explicit GL loader. An unloaded session still fails; the host owns GL context threading, current state, and teardown. |
| `container-render-skia/src/lib.rs` | The explicit GL loader rejects non-GL function names so GLX/WGL cannot provide non-callable non-null addresses for EGL names. Native EGL attachment retains its existing path. |
| `Cargo.lock` | Adds glutin/glow and transitive dependencies for desktop presentation without changing existing dependency versions; duplicate Objective-C dependencies carry explicit versions. |

The review also covers resize, zero-size invalidation, reload, presentation receipts, and shutdown in the standalone desktop host. Linux Xvfb/Mesa integration tests check pixels, resize, reload, and detach on a real GL drawable. These results do not establish Windows, Wayland, or physical-device acceptance and do not raise SDK acceptance status.

## 2026-11-13 testing runtime and toolchain review

Reviewed the test host and TypeScript migration against production boundaries on `origin/main`. Updated full-file identities for QuickJS, runtime, nativeProvider and manifestPacker, plus the scheduler AST identity. Capability ratings and historical acceptance evidence retain their existing status.

| Source | Changes and preserved boundaries |
| --- | --- |
| `container-engine-quickjs/src/lib.rs` | The testing feature uses private transport for instance and node observation. The real engine continues to own authority, execution budgets, exception handling and cleanup. |
| `container-runtime/src/lib.rs`, `container-sdk/src/lib.rs` | Testing interfaces compile behind a feature and reuse Session, pack verification, providers and shutdown. Controlled time reaches timer registration; real deadlines still bound execution. |
| `container-core/src/turn-scheduler.js` | The private status command only reports currently ready work for bounded flush convergence. It does not advance future timers or change callback ownership and cancellation semantics. |
| `tools/container-manifest/src/index.ts` | Migrated JS to TypeScript, added JSON / AST boundary types and moved the CLI into a separate entry. Existing tests validate deterministic manifests, resource digests, errors and WXS semantics. |

The receipt durability unit test explicitly uses a finite 2 s View budget so shared CI startup does not mask its target assertions with the 50 ms initialization budget. This override compiles only into unit tests; production and testing distributions retain their default budgets.

The review covers 24 real-runtime integration tests, 87 Rust SDK tests, scheduler callback compatibility tests, manifest regressions and declaration tests. Test processes and node handles bind to sessions; stale handle rejection, cancellation and cleanup failures have checks. These results do not raise device or WeChat compatibility acceptance status.

## Subsequent updates

1. Find the complete source of the last review, review the differences to the current file, and confirm authorization, ownership, life cycle, budget and failure semantics.
2. Fix broken assumptions in the implementation or checker first. Reverse mutation testing is retained; fixture replacements must hit a true and definite number of anchors.
3. Update only reviewed source summaries and AST identities. Only one copy of the shared identity can be retained, and each capability scope continues to explicitly select the source.
4. Run the behavioral tests of `node --test scripts/core-api-inventory.test.mjs`, `pnpm host:services:test` and the affected modules, and then generate and verify the matrix. Comparing all ability statuses, source updates by themselves cannot improve ratings.
5. The actual platform or transaction acceptance must provide additional evidence of meeting the contract; projects that have not been executed will continue to be marked as not accepted.
